# GDocs
Welcome to **GDocs** a public internal documentation site for FTC 772.

## Purpose?
This site is intended to be a centralized location for documentation related to FTC 772 projects, including Software, Mechanical, and Outreach. It is designed to help team members quickly find the information they need to work effectively on our team.

## About the Team
We are team 772, Golden Dragons from the South Carolina Governorâ€™s School for Science and Mathematics in Hartsville, South Carolina. Our team has an expansive history that dates back to the first FTC season in 2005. For more information about our team, robots, awards, and sponsors please visit our website: https://ftc772.org/

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to enhance the general knowledge and ability of students in South Carolina in regards to STEM. As Govies (and students from all over the state) we have an inherent responsibility to give back to the communities that help foster our success.
