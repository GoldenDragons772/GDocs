# Team Positions

## Team Captain(s)
The responsibility of the Team Captain(s) is to act as the showrunner. Their job is to oversee the entire team and keep things running as smoothly as possible. While the subteam captains need to look at the team from a technical and short term perspective, it is their job to see the team from a long term and less technical perspective. They have a product to deliver, and they need to make sure your team is doing the right things to get that product in a usable state on time. It is the Team Captainâ€™s responsibility to schedule meetings, manage documentation and keep up with the progress of the subteam captains. 

:::note
For the 2025-2026 season, all of our subteam captains/seniors are also co-captains. This is not a typical structure but it is what worked for us this year.

## Promotion Procedures
Future subteam and team captains are decided during the last few subteam captain meetings. The subteam captains and the team captain will work together to choose their successors. It is preferred that a single person is not the captain of more than one subteam, although this can happen in scenarios where it is best for the team as decided by leadership.
