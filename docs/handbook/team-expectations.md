# Team Expectations

## Attendance
If you’re unable to make it to a meeting for any reason, please notify a team captain or whoever is leading the meeting. GSSM is a very rigorous school, so we are very lenient with absences, just let us know! If you repeatedly can’t make it or clearly are avoiding putting effort we may consider suspending you from the team. We want you to do other activities outside of class, but if you are on 772 it should be your primary extracurricular focus. All we ask is that you communicate. 

:::warning
If, after a suspension, you continue to not complete your responsibilities even with reminders and assistance, you may be removed from 772.

Every minute you are late to a meeting = one push up. The juniors get a one month grace period before we enforce this onto them.

## Organization
Compared to many other FTC teams, our workspace is very small. We have an approximately 10’ x 10’ space in the robotics lab, which is very small for a team of 12 people. This means that it’s very important to keep our space organized and easy to move around. Avoid leaving things out on the tables unless it’s actively work in progress. Any parts that aren’t for a GD specific project should be put away in the all-team storage for everyone to use as needed. Tools should be kept in the packouts and tables should be mostly clear. If you have any questions about where things should be stored, please ask the bookkeeper, team captain, or Dr. Parshall. 

## Communication
Our team uses Discord to communicate. We expect every team member to actively engage and pay attention to the server. as it is where we announce team meetings, events, outreach, and many other important things relating to the team. We also occasionally use Outlook groups for more official communication concerning events or other more formal circumstances. 

## Safety Procedures
When building robots, we use many different tools ranging from screwdrivers to bandsaws. This requires some safety precautions to be taken. I’ve split the different machines we have access to into three categories, A, B, and C, with A being the least dangerous and C being the most dangerous. The chart below outlines the necessary safety procedure for each machine we have access to. It should go without saying, but do not use any Category B or C machines until you are trained on them by someone who already has experience with them.

| Category   | Tools                                      | Requirements                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A          | Screwdriver, Hammer, 3D Printers, Hacksaw  | Requires no extra protection                                                 |
| B          | Cordless Drill, Bandsaw                    | Requires attention whenever the machine is powered on, goggles, and another person in the room |
| C          | Laser/Plasma Cutter, CNC Mill              | Requires safety glasses, long pants, close-toed shoes and an adult in the room. |

Make sure not to use gloves or dangling items around rotating machines like the Drill Press.

## Team Representation
Everywhere you go, you are a representative of both 772 and GSSM. At events, it is expected that you remain courteous and helpful to all teams. Judges, mentors, referees and others who you interact with. It’s easy to dislike a team who is performing well that you don’t know, so introduce yourself to other teams! Show them that we want to help. Remember, our goal is to make all of SC FTC a better learning environment and better competitor on the world stage.

Being a part of FIRST also includes following ideals such as Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition. All 772 members are expected to exemplify these ideals in the robotics lab, at competitions, and in their everyday life. It is easy for tensions to run high with 4 sister teams or with competitors, especially if the others around you are not maintaining FIRST ideals. However, remember to take a deep breath and KEEP IT GP!

:::warning
Any egregious, unkind actions such as bullying, use of slurs, or creating an extremely hostile environment will result in removal from 772. While we try to be understanding of mistakes, we have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying or discrimination of any kind.
