# About FIRST

## What is FIRST?
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring young people to be leaders and innovators in science and technology. Through programs such as FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), students are encouraged to excel in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen (inventor of the Segway and the insulin pump) and Woodie Flowers (an infamously inventive MIT Professor) and has since become an international organization that has reached hundreds of thousands of students from elementary school through high school.

## FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)
The FIRST program we participate in is called the FIRST Tech Challenge. In FTC, a new challenge (also called a game) is released the first weekend of September of every year. This event, called kickoff, is the start of a months-long season in which students design, build, code and compete with their robots. Matches are played in an alliance vs alliance format, where each alliance consists of two teams. Teams are also highly encouraged to engage in outreach, both in and out of their community.
