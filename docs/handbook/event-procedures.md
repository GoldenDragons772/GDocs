# Event Procedures

## Scrimmages & League Meets
The schedule for all League Meets and scrimmages will be posted around the time the game is released. In-state events generally start at around 9 AM, meaning students need to be on the bus with the robot and tools at around 7 AM on Saturday mornings. It’s highly encouraged to pack and finalize all code/mechanical the night before so that things are ready to go in the morning. Students should expect to leave at around 7:30 AM and arrive back at GSSM around 5 PM

## State Tournament
The South Carolina Regional Championship is usually hosted in Columbia and is a two day event. This means that the team will likely be staying in a hotel. Students should expect to leave at around 12 PM on the setup day (usually a Saturday) and arrive back at around 9 PM the next day. The robot, tools, and pit supplies are expected to be packed the night before. 

## FIRST Championship
The FIRST Championship is a week-long event hosted in Houston, Texas that finalizes the official season and declares the winner of a given year’s game. Depending on the availability of GSSM bus drivers, we usually have the robot and pit supplies driven to Houston or brought on the plane in checked luggage. When coming from GSSM, we usually fly out of Charlotte International Airport with a direct flight to Houston. All plane tickets, hotels, and food will be paid for by GSSM. Other items like merchandise and other items are the financial responsibility of the student. Students are allowed one carry on and one personal item.
