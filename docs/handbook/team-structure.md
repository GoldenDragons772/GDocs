# Team Structure

## Recruiting
GSSM is a two year school. This makes recruiting extremely important, especially for team longevity. We generally recruit our members through prior connections and the robotics interest meeting, although exceptions may be made for mid-season recruiting. While technical skill is always good, we want team members who are passionate about whatever speciality of robotics that they work in. There isnâ€™t a set procedure, and it is mostly up to the Team Captain(s) and Outreach Subteam Captain to decide the method of recruitment for a given season.

## Subteam Descriptions
### Mechanical Team
The mechanical team is responsible for facilitating the design and fabrication of the robot, virtually and physically. Mechanical is also responsible for creating robot renders for the portfolio and assisting with the mechanical section of the portfolio. 

### Software Team
The software team is responsible for both creating programs that control the robot and providing explanations and documentation that explains their sometimes seemingly insane or irrational decisions to team members and judges. 

### Outreach Team
The outreach team is responsible for attending cross team outreach events, volunteering, mentoring, social media, and facilitating contact between other teams. Outreach is also responsible for the creation and iteration of the portfolio as well as the merchandise items that we hand out at events. 

### Electrical Team
The electrical team is responsible for making sure that everything related to wiring on the robot is tidy and workable. Electrical is also responsible for soldering cables, on-field repairs, wire splicing, and anything to do with items that interact with the control and expansion hubs.

### Scouting Team
The scouting team is responsible for gathering, analyzing and understanding the data behind what makes a good Alliance partner and picking accordingly. Scouting is also responsible for development and maintenance of the scouting database as well as understanding the statistical principles that it runs on.

### Drive Team
The drive team is responsible for driving the robot during matches, practicing, setting up autonomous, and occasional on-field repairs. They are also responsible for running practice matches and maintaining the robot for them.
