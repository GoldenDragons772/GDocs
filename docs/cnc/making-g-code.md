# Making G-Code

## What is G-Code?

G-Code (also known as RS-274) is a numerical control programming language that provides instructions to CNC machines. It tells the machine exactly how to move, where to go, what speed to use, and when to turn tools on or off. Think of it as the "language" that CNC machines understand to create precise cuts and movements.

## Why is G-Code Important?

G-Code is crucial for CNC operations because:

- **Precision Control**: It provides exact coordinates and movements for the machine
- **Tool Management**: Controls when to change tools, spindle speeds, and feed rates
- **Safety**: Includes commands for safe operation and emergency stops
- **Repeatability**: Ensures consistent results every time the program runs
- **Flexibility**: Allows for complex machining operations and custom toolpaths

## How G-Code is Generated

While you can write G-Code manually, it's typically generated by CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software such as:

- Autodesk Inventor CAM
- SolidWorks CAM
- Fusion 360

These programs take your 3D model and machining parameters to automatically generate the G-Code instructions.
