# Mach3

![Mach3 Interface](/img/mach3-placeholder.jpg)

Mach3 is used to control the CNC. It allows you to "jog" and run G-code generated by the CAM software of your choice. Mach3 is not very beginner-friendly, as I had a lot of trouble using the program, mainly setting it up and configuring it to work with the CNC at school. However, it is a great program that gets the job done and works well most of the time.

## Setting up Mach3
